# Pomodoro Quotes Extension

## Overview

The Pomodoro Quotes Extension is a productivity tool designed to help you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This technique involves working in focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. The extension not only helps you keep track of these intervals but also provides motivational quotes to encourage you to stay productive.

## Features

- **Timer**: A built-in timer that counts down from 25 minutes, signaling when it's time to take a break.
- **Notifications**: Alerts you with a custom message when the timer ends, encouraging you to take a break.
- **Motivational Quotes**: Displays motivational quotes to keep you inspired and focused during your work sessions.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Timer**: Click the start button to begin a 25-minute work session.
2. **Work**: Focus on your task until the timer alerts you.
3. **Take a Break**: When the timer ends, you'll receive a notification. Take a short break before starting the next session.
